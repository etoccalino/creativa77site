          <h4>Our clients</h4>
          <p>Our strengths and interests are an ideal match for small
        technology companies that need the flexibility and adaptability
        of a small team as well as very high talent and a high level of
        engagement. Coincidentally, we are currently working with technology start-up
        companies from the Silicon Valley.</p>

          <h4>Technology transfer</h4>
          <p>
        We specialize in bridging the gap between scientific research and
        deployable product: we can work with complex, under-documented
        technology and we have the engineering and usability experience to bring
        real products into the market.
          </p>

          <h4>Effective virtual teams</h4>
          <p>Our team has many years of experience in
        global, remote collaboration and has repeatedly succeeded at creating an
        effective, tightly-knit day-to-day working experience with our
        customers. In practice, we become an integral part of our customers'
        development teams.</p>

           <h4>Virtually close</h4>
           <p>Our timezone location (GMT-3) makes it easy to maintain
        multiple-hour, sometimes full-day overlap with North American
        and European customers. This further helps us work hand-in-hand
        with our customers and be present during important
        deadlines and deliverables.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="span6">
         <h4>Quality people</h4>
		<p>Our engineers are carefully chosen for their
		world-class software engineering skills. We keep them
		interested by offering them the chance to work on
		cutting-edge projects with international customers at the
		forefront of technology innovation.
		</p>

          <h4>Fast learners</h4>
          <p>We are passionate about technology. We love engaging in
        opportunities for which we have to learn something new.
        We dive into your project environment, understand it,
        and work with you on it. Adapting quickly is one of
        our key strengths.
		  </p>

          <h4>Technology expertise</h4>
          <p>
        We specialize in the following areas:
        <ul>
          <li>Real-time Web application development
          <li>Simple usable interfaces to complex systems
          <li>Web robotics
          <li>Remote collaboration tools
        </ul>

        and have developed expertise in a variety of technologies,
        including: JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, Android, HTML5, 
        ROS, Web Sockets, Socket.IO, Django, Ruby on Rails, Node,
        Ember, Ansible, Git and many more
          </p>

          <h4>Where we are</h4>
          <p>Creativa 77's offices are located in the beautiful city
		of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We invite everyone we work with
		to come visit us and enjoy what Buenos Aires has to
		offer!</p>
